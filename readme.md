# Mini-CPU Project

Custom CPU architecture written in VHDL. I made this project for purely educational purposes and for the sake of fun (hail science!).

The final goal is to make it run and execute a program on FPGA and maybe more by adding peripherals to the CPU like a GPU nor a controller.

This is currently WIP. This project is at a really early stage.
